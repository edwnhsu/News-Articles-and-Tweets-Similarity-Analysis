### News Articles and Tweets Similarity Analysis
This project focuses on identifying the similarity between a collection of news articles and tweets using n-grams and Jaccard distance. The analysis was completed as part of the UChicago Applied Data Science program.

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to determine which news articles are similar to each other and which tweets are similar, using n-grams and Jaccard distance for text comparison.

**Steps:**
1. Text Cleaning: Preprocess the news articles and tweets by removing noise, stopwords, and performing tokenization.
2. N-Grams Creation: Generate n-grams for both the news articles and tweets to represent text for similarity comparison.
3. Jaccard Distance Calculation: Compare the similarity of texts by calculating Jaccard distance between different n-grams.
4. Analysis: Identify which articles/tweets are most similar and which are dissimilar.
5. Parameter Selection: Analyze and explain the choice of “n” for n-grams and how it differs between articles and tweets.
6. Combination of Text and Title: For news articles, evaluate the impact of comparing text alone, title alone, or both combined.
7. Visualization: Visualize the results, including the selection of “n” and the similarity between texts.
   
**Results**
* **Most Similar and Dissimilar Texts:** Lists of news articles and tweets that show the highest and lowest similarity scores.
* **N-Gram Selection:** Explanation and visualization of the optimal “n” for news articles vs. tweets.
* **Text vs. Title:** Justification of whether text, title, or a combination was used for news articles.

**Conclusion**

This project showcases how n-grams and Jaccard distance can be effectively used to compare textual data such as news articles and tweets, helping to identify patterns of similarity.
